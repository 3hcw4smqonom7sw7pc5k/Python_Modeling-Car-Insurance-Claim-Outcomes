Reading in and exploring the dataset\n\nCreate a pandas DataFrame and examine for data types, missing values, and distributions.\nExploring the data\n\n    Read in the dataset as a pandas DataFrame using pd.read_csv().\n    Explore the data to see what the values look like, the data types, missing values, and distributions.\n    You can use methods such as .head(), .info(), and .describe().\n\n2. Filling missing values\n\nPrepare data for modeling by ensuring there are no missing values.\nFilling missing values with an appropriate statistic\n\n    Two of the columns have missing values, and their values appear to be normally distributed.\n    Replace missing values in these columns with the mean.\n    You can use the Series .fillna() method to fill missing values, passing the .mean() of the respective column.\n\n3. Preparing for modeling\n\nCreate variables for modeling and storing the results.\nCreating a list to store the models\n\n    Create an empty list called models to store each model object created.\n    You can create an empty list using square brackets, e.g., a_list = [].\n\nStoring the features as a variable\n\n    Create a variable called features, containing all columns except for \"outcome\" and \"id\".\n    To get all the features you can chain the .drop() method, passing a list of columns to drop, with the .columns attribute.\n\n4. Building and storing the models\n\nBuild one model per feature and save the results to a list.\nModeling with a for loop\n\n    Loop through features.\n    Inside the for loop, create a Logistic Regression model to estimate the relationship between \"outcome\" and the iterator from features, fitting the data, and saving as a variable called models.\n    You can use an f-string to pass a variable inside a string through the use of curly brackets {}. For example, to print the name of the iterator feature in a for loop:\n\n\nfor col in features:\n  print(f\"{col}\"\")\n\n    Append the model to the models list.\n\n5. Measuring performance\n\nCalculate the accuracy of each model.\nCreating a list to store model accuracies\n\n    Create an empty list and store it as accuracies.\n\nLooping through the index of the models list\n\n    Iterate over the index of models.\n    The iterable should be a list of numbers from 0 to the maximum index in models, which can be accomplished using range(len(models)).\n\nCreating a confusion matrix and storing individual metrics\n\n    Store each model's confusion matrix by selecting the ith model from models and call the pred_table() method, saving as conf_matrix.\n    Find and store the true negatives, true positives, false negatives, and false positives from conf_matrix.\n    The true negatives are the top-left value, true positives are the bottom right, false negatives are the bottom left, and false positives are the top right.\n    To extract the true negatives use the syntax conf_matrix[0,0].\n\nCalculating accuracy and storing the model's results\n\n    Calculate accuracy, which is the sum of true negatives and positives divided by the sum of all values in the confusion matrix.\n    Append the model's accuracy to the accuracies list.\n\n6. Finding the best performing model\n\nLocate which model has the highest accuracy score.\nIdentifying the index of accuracies with the largest score\n\n    You can find the index of an item in a list by calling the list's .index() method.\n    Inside .index(), you need to look up the max() value in accuracies.\n\nMapping the highest accuracy to the feature\n\n    Slice features using square brackets [] containing the index of the model in accuracies with the highest score.\n    Use .pd.DataFrame() to create a pandas DataFrame, passing a dictionary with \"best_feature\" and \"best_accuracy\" as keys, along with the feature and its accuracy score as values.\n    Set the index keyword argument equal to a list containing 0.\n    Click the \"Submit Project\" button to check your solution!","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ed7e0aec-2fa5-41ba-93c6-c3cc715015ae"},{"source":"<center><img src=\"car.jpg\" width=500></center>\n\n\nInsurance companies invest a lot of time and money into optimizing their pricing and accurately estimating the likelihood that customers will make a claim.
